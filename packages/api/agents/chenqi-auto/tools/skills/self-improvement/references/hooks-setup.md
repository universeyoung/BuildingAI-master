# Hook Setup Guide

Configure automatic self-improvement triggers for AI coding agents.

## Overview

Hooks enable proactive learning capture by injecting reminders at key moments:
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Reminder after each prompt to evaluate learnings
- **PostToolUse (Bash)**: Error detection when commands fail

## Setup

### Minimal Setup (Activator Only)

For lower overhead, use only the UserPromptSubmit hook:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "./skills/self-improvement/scripts/activator.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Full Setup (With Error Detection)

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "./skills/self-improvement/scripts/activator.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "./skills/self-improvement/scripts/error-detector.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Available Hook Scripts

| Script | Hook Type | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `scripts/activator.sh` | UserPromptSubmit | Reminds to evaluate learnings after tasks |
| `scripts/error-detector.sh` | PostToolUse (Bash) | Triggers on command errors |

## Verification

### Test Activator Hook

1. Enable the hook configuration
2. Start a new session
3. Send any prompt
4. Verify you see `<self-improvement-reminder>` in the context

### Test Error Detector Hook

1. Enable PostToolUse hook for Bash
2. Run a command that fails: `ls /nonexistent/path`
3. Verify you see `<error-detected>` reminder

### Dry Run Extract Script

```bash
./skills/self-improvement/scripts/extract-skill.sh test-skill --dry-run
```

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Triggering

1. **Check script permissions**: `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
2. **Verify path**: Use absolute paths or paths relative to project root
3. **Restart session**: Hooks are loaded at session start

### Permission Denied

```bash
chmod +x ./skills/self-improvement/scripts/activator.sh
chmod +x ./skills/self-improvement/scripts/error-detector.sh
chmod +x ./skills/self-improvement/scripts/extract-skill.sh
```

### Too Much Overhead

If the activator feels intrusive:

1. **Use minimal setup**: Only UserPromptSubmit, skip PostToolUse
2. **Add matcher filter**: Only trigger for certain prompts:

```json
{
  "matcher": "fix|debug|error|issue",
  "hooks": [...]
}
```

## Hook Output Budget

The activator is designed to be lightweight:
- **Target**: ~50-100 tokens per activation
- **Content**: Structured reminder, not verbose instructions
- **Format**: XML tags for easy parsing
