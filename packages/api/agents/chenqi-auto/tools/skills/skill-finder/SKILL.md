# Skill Finder

When a user asks to **find**, **search**, **discover**, or **install** agent skills — or says things like "how do I do X", "is there a skill for X", "can you do X" — use this skill to search across platforms, evaluate results, and install the best match.

## Available Platforms

| Platform | Best For | Search Method | Speed | Catalog Size | Auth |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------|-------------|------|
| **Internal Catalog** | Official/first-party skills, already vetted, instant install | Local file read | ⚡ Instant | ~60 | ❌ Not required |
| **skills.sh** | Open-source, workflow automation, quick install | CLI: `npx skills find` | ⚡ Fast | ~Thousands | ❌ Not required |
| **ClawHub** | Community-driven, version management, publishing | CLI: `clawhub search` | ⚡ Fast | Community | ⚠️ Optional |
| **SkillsMP** | Largest database, AI semantic search, niche/research | REST API | 🐢 5–15s | 283K+ | ✅ Required |

## Decision Tree

### Step 1: Analyze User Query

**Specific platform requested:**
- "from internal" / "internal catalog" / "our skills" → search Internal Catalog only
- "from skills.sh" → search skills.sh only
- "from clawhub" → search ClawHub only
- "from skillsmp" → search SkillsMP only

**Otherwise → ALWAYS start with Internal Catalog (Step 1.5), then escalate if needed.**

### Step 1.5: Search Internal Skill Catalog (ALWAYS do this first)

The internal catalog contains all official/first-party skills — both installed and uninstalled. This is the fastest and most reliable source.

**How to search:**

```bash
# Read the local skills cache and search by keyword
cat ~/.accio/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/skills/remote_skills_cache.json | \
  python3 -c "
import json, sys
query = 'USER_QUERY_KEYWORDS'.lower().split()
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
for s in data['skills']:
    text = (s['name'] + ' ' + s.get('description', '')).lower()
    if any(q in text for q in query):
        print(f\"  {s['name']}\")
        print(f\"    {s.get('description', 'No description')[:150]}\")
        print()
"
```

Replace `ACCOUNT_ID` with the actual account ID from the agent's skill directory path, and `USER_QUERY_KEYWORDS` with space-separated search terms derived from the user's query.

**After finding a match in the internal catalog:**

1. Check if the skill is already in `<available_skills>` in the system prompt:
   - If YES → tell the user it's already installed and enabled, and offer to use it directly
   - If NO → the skill needs to be installed. Tell the user you found a matching internal skill and what it does, then offer to install it

**To determine install status**, check if the skill directory exists locally:
```bash
# Check account-level skills
ls ~/.accio/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/skills/SKILL_NAME/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null && echo "installed" || echo "not installed"

# Check agent-level skills
ls ~/.accio/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/agents/AGENT_ID/agent-core/skills/SKILL_NAME/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null && echo "installed" || echo "not installed"
```

If the skill is not installed, it can be installed via the SDK server API or by downloading from the OSS URL in the cache:
```bash
# The oss field in remote_skills_cache.json contains the download URL
# Extract it and download:
OSS_URL=$(cat ~/.accio/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/skills/remote_skills_cache.json | \
  python3 -c "import json,sys; data=json.load(sys.stdin); [print(s['oss']) for s in data['skills'] if s['name']=='SKILL_NAME']")

# Download and extract to agent-level skills directory (Optimized)
DIR="~/.accio/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/agents/AGENT_ID/agent-core/skills/SKILL_NAME"
mkdir -p "$DIR" && curl -sL "$OSS_URL" -o /tmp/skill.zip && \
  unzip -q -o /tmp/skill.zip -d "$DIR" && \
  mv "$DIR"/SKILL_NAME/* "$DIR"/ 2>/dev/null; \
  rmdir "$DIR"/SKILL_NAME 2>/dev/null; \
  rm /tmp/skill.zip
```

**If a good internal match is found → use it. Only proceed to external platforms if no suitable internal skill exists.**

### Step 2: Choose Search Strategy (External Platforms)

Only reach this step if the Internal Catalog search in Step 1.5 found no suitable match.

#### Environment Check (IMPORTANT)

Before searching external platforms, check if the required CLIs are installed. If missing, install them first:

```bash
# Check if clawhub is installed
clawhub -h >/dev/null 2>&1 || npm i -g clawhub
```

#### Strategy A: Single Platform (Fast — Default)

1. Run `npx skills find <query>`
2. If a good match is found → **pick the best match and install it directly** (do not ask for user confirmation; prefer official/popular packages)
3. If not found or poor match → proceed to Strategy B

**Example output from `npx skills find`:**
```
Install with npx skills add <owner/repo@skill>

vercel-labs/agent-skills@vercel-react-best-practices
└ https://skills.sh/vercel-labs/agent-skills/vercel-react-best-practices
```

#### Strategy B: Multi-Platform Search (Comprehensive)

Use when Strategy A yields no/poor results, or user asks for "best" / "any" / "comprehensive" search, or query is specialized/niche.

Search all three platforms in parallel:

```bash
# Platform 1: skills.sh
npx skills find <query>

# Platform 2: ClawHub
clawhub search <query>

# Platform 3: SkillsMP (API)
SKILLSMP_API_KEY=$(grep SKILLSMP_API_KEY .env | cut -d '=' -f2 | tr -d '"')
curl -X GET "https://skillsmp.com/api/v1/skills/ai-search?q=<url-encoded-query>&limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SKILLSMP_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

Aggregate and deduplicate results by GitHub URL. Score by relevance, stars, and recent updates. Present:

```
Found X skills across 3 platforms:

From skills.sh (Y results):
- skill-name by author — description
  https://skills.sh/owner/repo/skill-name

From ClawHub (Z results):
- skill-name by author — description

From SkillsMP (W results):
- skill-name by author (score: 0.95, ⭐ 29)
  https://github.com/owner/repo
```

#### Strategy C: Retry with Alternative Keywords

If the first search returns no suitable results, try **alternative queries** — synonyms, broader/narrower terms. Retry up to **3 times total** with different queries per platform.

**Example:** if `npx skills find deploy` has no good match, try:
1. `npx skills find deployment`
2. `npx skills find ci-cd`

After 3 attempts across platforms with no suitable result:
1. Inform the user no existing skill was found
2. Offer to help with the task directly using general capabilities
3. Suggest creating a custom skill: `npx skills init my-skill`

## Common Skill Categories

When choosing search terms, consider these common categories:

| Category | Example Queries |
|----------|----------------|
| Web Development | react, nextjs, typescript, css, tailwind |
| Testing | testing, jest, playwright, e2e |
| DevOps | deploy, docker, kubernetes, ci-cd |
| Documentation | docs, readme, changelog, api-docs |
| Code Quality | review, lint, refactor, best-practices |
| Design | ui, ux, design-system, accessibility |
| Productivity | workflow, automation, git |
| Research | arxiv, papers, academic, analysis |
| E-commerce | shopify, product, marketing, sourcing |

**Tips:**
- Use specific keywords: "react testing" > "testing"
- Try alternative terms: "deploy" → "deployment" → "ci-cd"
- Check popular sources: `vercel-labs/agent-skills`, community agent skill repositories

## SkillsMP API Reference

### AI Semantic Search (recommended)

**Endpoint:** `GET https://skillsmp.com/api/v1/skills/ai-search`

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `q` | Yes | Natural language query (URL-encoded) |
| `limit` | No | Results to return (default 20, max 100) |

> **Note:** Keyword Search (`/skills/search`) is currently unstable (returns `INTERNAL_ERROR`). Always use AI search.

**Response format:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "data": [
      {
        "score": 0.9956,
        "skill": {
          "name": "arxiv-search",
          "author": "DeevsDeevs",
          "description": "Search arXiv preprints...",
          "githubUrl": "https://github.com/...",
          "skillUrl": "https://skillsmp.com/skills/...",
          "stars": 29,
          "updatedAt": 1770255689
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Parse results with jq:**

```bash
curl -s "https://skillsmp.com/api/v1/skills/ai-search?q=arxiv+papers&limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SKILLSMP_API_KEY" -H "Accept: application/json" \
  | jq -r '.data.data[] | "\(.skill.name) by \(.skill.author)\n  \(.skill.description[0:100])...\n  ⭐ \(.skill.stars) | \(.skill.githubUrl)\n"'
```

**Score interpretation:** > 0.95 excellent · 0.90–0.95 good · 0.85–0.90 fair · < 0.85 weak

**Rate limits:** 500 requests/day per key. Resets at midnight UTC. Headers: `X-RateLimit-Daily-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Daily-Remaining`.

**Common errors:**

| Code | Status | Fix |
|------|--------|-----|
| `INVALID_API_KEY` | 401 | Check `.env` for correct key |
| `MISSING_QUERY` | 400 | Add `q` parameter |
| `DAILY_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` | 429 | Wait until midnight UTC |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | 500 | Use AI search instead of keyword search |

**API key setup:**
- Get key at: https://skillsmp.com/docs/api (format: `sk_live_skillsmp_xxx...`)
- Configure: `echo 'SKILLSMP_API_KEY="sk_live_skillsmp_xxx..."' >> .env`

**Troubleshooting:**
- Empty results → use descriptive natural language, try broader terms, combine multiple keywords
- No API key → guide user to https://skillsmp.com/docs/api to generate a free key

## Installation Guidelines

After finding a skill, install it to the **correct directory**.

### ⚠️ DO NOT manually edit skills.jsonc

The `skills.jsonc` file is managed automatically by the PC runtime.
To install a skill, only place the skill directory under the correct path.
The runtime will auto-discover and register it. Manual edits to `skills.jsonc`
will be overwritten and may corrupt the skill registry.

### Directory Structure

| Level | Path | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Agent-specific** (default) | `~/.accio/accounts/{accountId}/agents/{agentId}/agent-core/skills/` | Only this agent |
| **Account-shared** | `~/.accio/accounts/{accountId}/skills/` | All agents in the account |

**Default: Always install to the agent's own directory** unless the user explicitly asks for account-level/global installation.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: npx skills add Creates Subdirectory

`npx skills add` will ALWAYS create a `.agents/skills/` subdirectory in the current directory. The loader expects skills exactly one level below `skills/`, so this nested path will fail to load. Always use the "Install + Move" method below.

### Recommended Installation Methods

#### Method 1: git clone (DEFAULT — Safest)

Best for repositories that represent a single skill.

```bash
cd ~/.accio/accounts/{accountId}/agents/{agentId}/agent-core/skills/
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git <skill-name>
```

#### Method 2: "Install + Move" (Best for Monorepos/Sub-skills)

Use when installing a specific sub-skill from a large monorepo via `npx skills add`.

```bash
cd ~/.accio/accounts/{accountId}/agents/{agentId}/agent-core/skills/
npx skills add <repo> --skill <name> -y
mv .agents/skills/<name> ./
rm -rf .agents
```

#### Method 3: clawhub install

Always use `--force` for non-interactive installations (e.g., in agents) to bypass "suspicious skill" prompts.

```bash
clawhub install <slug> --dir ~/.accio/accounts/{accountId}/agents/{agentId}/agent-core/skills/ --force
```

#### Method 4: SkillsMP → GitHub clone

Extract `githubUrl` from the SkillsMP API response, then use Method 1.

#### Method 5: Internal Catalog (Optimized ZIP) — DEFAULT for Official Skills

Recommended for installing official skills from the internal catalog via OSS URL. Handles nested directory extraction in a single command.

```bash
DIR="~/.accio/accounts/{accountId}/agents/{agentId}/agent-core/skills/{skillName}"
URL="OSS_URL_FROM_CACHE"
mkdir -p "$DIR" && curl -sL "$URL" -o /tmp/skill.zip && \
  unzip -q -o /tmp/skill.zip -d "$DIR" && \
  mv "$DIR"/{skillName}/* "$DIR"/ 2>/dev/null; \
  rmdir "$DIR"/{skillName} 2>/dev/null; \
  rm /tmp/skill.zip
```

### Account-Level Skills (Shared)

Only when user explicitly requests global/shared installation:
`~/.accio/accounts/{accountId}/skills/`

### Verification After Installation

```bash
# Verify skill directory exists directly under skills/
ls ~/.accio/accounts/{accountId}/agents/{agentId}/agent-core/skills/<skill-name>/

# Verify SKILL.md exists
cat ~/.accio/accounts/{accountId}/agents/{agentId}/agent-core/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```
